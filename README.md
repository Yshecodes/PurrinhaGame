# Purrinha Game

Welcome! This project is being developed in collaboration with https://github.com/AlineSug

Game Description

Purrinha is a simple game commonly played at bars in Brazil.
While traditionally played with toothpicks, any small objects that can be held in hands will suffice.

Game Rules of this version 1.0:

1. The game starts with 3 players:
   You and two computer-controlled opponents.

2. Every player starts the game with 3 sticks.

3. In each round, players can hide from 0 up to the amount of sticks they currently have.

4. A randomly selected player starts guessing.

5. Players take turns guessing clockwise.

6. Each guess in a round must be unique.

7. After all guesses are made, players reveal their hands.

8. The player who guessed correctly the total amount of toothpicks, scores 1 point and discards 1 stick.

9. Following rounds continue until a player discards all 3 sticks, reaching 3 points and winning the game.
