Stick Guess Game

Welcome! This project is being developed in collaboration with https://github.com/AlineSug

This is a simple game played at many bars in Brazil.

The game starts with 3 players. 
You and other 2 machine players.

On game start all players start with 3 sticks.
A random player will be selected to start guessing first.
Guessing turns are clockwise.

On each round players must decide how many sticks they will hide in their hands.
Then, starting player will choose their guess, followed by the next players.
Each guess of the current round must be unique.

Once everyone has chosen their guess, players open their hands, whoever guessed right
the total amount of sticks, scores 1 point and drops 1 sticks. 
When a player drops all 3 sticks(score 3 points) he/she is the winner of the game.
Rounds restart when no one guessed right and until there is a game winner.
